# Approximation and Generalization of DeepONets for Learning Operators Arising from a Class of Singularly Perturbed Problems

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and experimental code for the paper "Approximation and Generalization of DeepONets for Learning Operators Arising from a Class of Singularly Perturbed Problems". Our work focuses on applying Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) to solve singularly perturbed problems, exploring their approximation capabilities and generalization properties.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following key files:

- `generate_data_Xd.py`: Generates training and test datasets for X-dimensional problems
- `train_Xd.py`: Trains models for X-dimensional problems
- `Xd_plot.py`: Produces figures for X-dimensional problem results
- `plot_figure8.py`: Generates Figure 8 as presented in the paper

Note: Replace 'X' with the specific dimension (e.g., 1d, 2d) in the filenames above.
